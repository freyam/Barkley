## Background

_He's a dog and a butler, who wouldn't love him?_
                                            -Jay
Online friendships are hard. Online bestfriendships are even harder. Online romantic relationships are even weirder.
Online, discord has become our little reality. Presenting - Barkley, the Butler. Barkley is more than a bot, it makes your server your next home.

Barkley caters specifically to some of our specific needs, as we'll speak about them as you read about the features. 

## Features
### DM Style Tags
`.` - To ghost tag your listeners.
> _**Why this feature?** Well, this delivers the experience of a DM, but on a server- Badge Icons without the pain of tagging._


`.listen @<username>` to listen to a user. When they enter a `.`, you get a ping.
`.ghost @<username>` to prevent the user from tagging you using `.`

### Server Organisation
_What lengths one wouldn't go to serve their laziness...

People kinda just end up sending everything in `#general`, it's convenient. What if you could send the messages to the right channel from the comfort of
the ONE messy channel?_


`.add <keyword>` Type this in a channel of your choice, and now the bot labels your channel using this keyword.

`<keyword> <message>` Type this in any channel, and this message is instead sent to the correct channel (The bot imitates you using a webhook)

`<keyword>` Reply to a message with this, and a copy of the original message, including attachments is sent to the correct channel

`<keywords> -` Replying with this to a message will send the original message to the right channel, and delete it from the current channel.

### Server disguise

_Oh, nononono, mom's here._ (Or maybe your snooping neighbour, meh.)

This is the discord version of stashing away stuff in a closet.

`.j` Type this to get access to all the fun channels.
`.j` Also type this if you want to hide away all of that. 

<!-- ## Usage

`.` to ping all your listeners
`.listen @<username>` to get pings when <username> sends a `.`
`.ghost @<username>` to disable pings when <username> sends a `.`

## Use case

You most likely do not need this butler.
We decided to migrate our chats into a server for better organisation.
Servers don't give you badge notifications for messages, sensibly so.

If you wanted to ping all your listeners (i.e. that care about what you have to say), just send a `.`, and
they get a ping! best part, it's a ghost tag. -->
