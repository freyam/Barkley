# Barkley - A Discord Doggo

## Usage

`.` to ping all your listeners
`.listen @<username>` to get pings when <username> sends a `.`
`.ghost @<username>` to disable pings when <username> sends a `.`

## Use case

You most likely do not need this butler.
We decided to migrate our chats into a server for better organisation.
Servers don't give you badge notifications for messages, sensibly so.

If you wanted to ping all your listeners (i.e. that care about what you have to say), just send a `.`, and
they get a ping! best part, it's a ghost tag.
